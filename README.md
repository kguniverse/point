# Point cloud detection System Demo Repo

## quickstart

> We mainly use mmdet3d:1.1.x framwork, however, it appears that the visualization hook still not work (lidar-det). So we just make a backup, with two different branchs to train & deploy the same model.

## projects

- [x] init mmopenlab 2.0 branch
- [x] train pointpillars in 2.0
- [x] init mmopenlab 1.0 branch
- [ ] train pointpillars in 1.0
- [ ] visualize the result (mm 1.0)
- [ ] import mmdeploy in different branchs
